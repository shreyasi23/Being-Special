# Being-Special
Payment gateway integration project

In this project I have made a website called Being Special which is an NGO (not a real one) that works for the welfare of specially-abled (differently-abled).It is a basic website developed using HTML5 and CSS. It consists of four pages:
1. Home 
2. About
3. Donate
4. Contact

The main part of this project is the donate page, where I have done the payment gateway integration. The payment page and payment button is created using Razorpay and background of all the pages of the website are designed using Canva.
